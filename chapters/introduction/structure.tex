\subsection{Document Structure}%
\label{sub:Document Structure}

So far, section~\ref{sub:Problem_Statement} already introduced the problems
this thesis tries to tackle. In the upcoming
section~\ref{sub:Design_Science_Research}, the methodology that is utilised to
produce solutions for these problems is presented.

Once the organizational aspects are established, chapter~\ref{sec:Background}
provides the grounding for the solution search process. It covers all the
relevant theoretical topics from microservices over the container orchestration
solution \textit{Kubernetes}, the continuous build and deployment process of
microservices, the different environments in which a continuous deployment can
be performed to the versioning schemes commonly used in software development.

\todo{Update chapter references} Chapters~\ref{sec:Versioning}, XX and XX then
try to produce solutions to the problems stated in the introductory chapter.
\todo{Add listing of problems that are discussed in ch. 3-5}.

Chapter~\ref{sec:Conclusion} summarizes the finding of this thesis. Finally,
chapter~\ref{sec:Outlook} provides an outlook on what further research can be
conducted on the topic of continuously deployed microservices. It also states
how the research conducted as part of this thesis can be improved or
supplemented.
